```
18:58 <Munter> I was thinking of building all todomvcs with it for demo
18:58 <addyosmani_> lol
18:59 <addyosmani_> If you're able to do anything with all the todomvcs, I'm impressed. Even a few is something
18:59 <Munter> challenge accepted :)
```

I suspect lots of trouble and bug reports ahead. Wish me luck...
